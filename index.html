               Cooking is my passion. <br>
            I love everything about cooking; <br>
            the smells the techniques, baking, braising, broiling, browning, basting and all of the other b words that have to do with cooking.
            In fact, I love all of the other letters that involve cooking, but that 'b' was just rolling off my keyboard. <br>
            I started seriously cooking nearly 18 years ago... aaand I just had a hard realization that it was 18 years ago and I was 18. Wow. <br> Anyway, 
            it started with calling my mom and asking her for a recipe. Meatloaf. "You'll just throw in a little bit of this and a little bit of that," were
            her directions. The end result didn't turn out too bad actually- but it wasn't great and most definitely did not taste like hers.

             I was determined to make good food. I love food with everything that I am. I love cooking for people and I love eating. Food is my life. <br>
             I think about food constantly and my social media food account is flooded with people eating delicous food... which I am not mad about... <br>
             I manipulated the algorithm to be just so haha.

             So I cooked and I cooked.. and I cooked and I cooked. I discovered I love to challenge myself with really hard-to-make recipes. I love to make every single thing from scratch.<br>
             From the mayo on my cheeseburger to the buns and pickles. I love the freedom I have when I am in the kitchen. Working hours and hours to finally come up with a delicous meal is one of the best<br>
             feelings in the world.

               Since I love to look at other people's food they eat or create, I decided to make my own "food insta." It's not much, but it showcases all of the delicous food I have created...<br>
               Unless I forget to take a picture, which is most of the time lol. I am hoping to continue my food journey while I learn to code, and eventually come up with a business in which I can integrate <br>
               both of the things that I love to do!
